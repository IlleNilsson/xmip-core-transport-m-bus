# xmip-core-transport-m-bus

M-Bus transport: EN 13757 wired metering over a serial line — short and long frames, SND_UD and REQ_UD2 answered by RSP_UD, a Stream as variable data records across as many telegrams as it takes; a loopback meter stands in for the line. A technology of [xmip-core-transport](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-transport).

A send target is read by `net::Target` in [xmip-core-library-net](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-library-net), the one reading of a URI every technology calls: scheme, authority, path and decoded query. Until 2026-09-28 it was read through the transport capability's `socket::target`, which split it on its first slash and left the query in the path.

## Toolchain
